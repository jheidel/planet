## Planet Data Viewer

This project is a map tile server which wraps the [Planet Developer API](https://developers.planet.com/).
It implements on-demand mosaics and drill-down.

A public web frontend is available: https://planet.jeffheidel.com

This is just a hobby project so please don't post the link to social media.
If my AppEngine budget blows up I'll need to implement access controls.

Built with [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/) and [Go](https://golang.org/).
